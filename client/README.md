ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I was able to build an express server with GET and POST endpoints and connected them to the database, that's literally it.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

I couldn't render the posts on the client, heck I couldn't even console log the entries. If I cant do that I can't really move on with the rest of it.


ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
